  <strong>U.S. Army Medicine Civilian Corps</strong> recruits civilian healthcare professionals to be employed by the Federal Government, primary under the U.S. Army. As part of an agency, I worked on creating and executing their marketing campaigns between 2014 - 2016. I worked on various large-scale projects, including promotional items, print/online advertisements, and the redesign of their website. I lead the development process on the website redesign project, taking the designers files and building a scalable, compliant, and mobile responsive website.
